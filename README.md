# Third-Class

# Class_003 - CSS

# Today's Schedule

- CSS is more complex than HTML. Not more complicated, but complex. There are more nuances and we'll need to go very slow and cover just a few things. Then we can start doing some really cool stuff!
- Let's build an HTML document really quickly with what we know so far:
  - html, head, body, div, h1, p, img
- Now let's talk about an new HTML tag
  - link (don't worry about what it does yet, just look at the structure)
  - the link tag allows us to pull in a CSS file which will style our HTML DOM.
  - take note of the path and where we put our CSS file.
- So what can we do with CSS?
  - first lets look at the structure of a CSS statement.
  - it's a bit different that HTML
    - we "select" what to modify
    - then we use attributes and values to make the changes
- Let's make some changes!
  - background-color
  - font
  - width
  - height
  - margin
  - padding
  - display
- Now how do we use selectors other than the HTML tag type?
  - class
  - id (for next time)

# Boiler (starting code for website)

As promised. Here is a link to an HTML Boilerplate. It includes JavaScript, but doesn't do anything. However, one thing you should take note of is the "reset.css" file. That removes all that annoying default styling from the browser. We'll talk about why to use that next week!

# NEXT WEEK!

We're going to cover just a bit more CSS and then start programming!

Programming! Whaaaaat?! We’re going to learn about programming using two environments: processing, and javascript. JavaScript can be a bit confusing so we’ll start with universal basics in processing and then take that knowledge to the web! Also Processing is super super fun.
